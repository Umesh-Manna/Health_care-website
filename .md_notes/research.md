## Some things to research on

- research about more features of .md and .xml files, for richer note taking.
- need to study display flex, used for formating. 
- how to add **breadcrumbs** in website
- CSS sizing properties
- When inspecting my website, the height of the webpage is changing, but when for medline it is stable
		my guess is that it is related to the **vh** attribute i have been using


## Learning by doing

- Using **<list>** more often. 
- Using **anchor** tag to make texts behave like buttons
	and also we can add images to act as button using the same property as well. 
	
- Using <dl>, <dt> and <dd> tag for defination
		good for semantic purposes. 
- placing anchor tag <a> inside <p>, to make the link text appear at the same line as that of the paragraph. 
- using **vh** and **vw**, **em** and **rem**, **%** for sizing. 
- using **text-align** property to align text in a container, instead of needlessly relying on display:flex.
- using **margin:auto** to center the container in the webpage with respect to the width, again removing the need of needles cons 		**display: flex** bloat. 
- <form> tag is another semantic tag, which can be used to contain HTML form element
- when setting height or width of the element, avoid using pixels as much as possible. 
- Don't add height to <body>. This will interfere with the size properties of the child elements if the total height of them is more than the body tag
- Using **max:height** and **min:height**
-
